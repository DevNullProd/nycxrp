This repo contains content and materials of revelance to the NYC/XRP meetup, a regular gathering of [XRP](https://xrpl.org/) contributors and enthusiasts in NYC and the surrounding areas.

Interesting in finding out more?! Join the [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-XRP/)! Not only do we regularily host events (currently every other month) but the mailing list is a great way to stay in touch with other **Zerp'rs** in the area.

See you at the next meetup!
